## Privacy Policy

This website is statically generated and serves pre-rendered pages. It does not include dynamic content, user logins, or form submissions. Visitors may access and read content without providing any personal data.

## Personal Data Collection

The website does not collect personal information from visitors. There are no registration forms, comment sections, contact forms, or upload features. As such, no personally identifiable information is stored or processed by the site.

## Cookies

The website may use strictly necessary cookies to support basic security, performance, or availability functions. These cookies are set by the hosting infrastructure and do not collect personal data or track users across sites. They are essential to ensure that the website operates reliably and securely.

## Embedded Content

Some pages may include embedded content, such as videos hosted on YouTube. Embedded content from external websites behaves as if the visitor has accessed the external site directly. These third-party services may set cookies, collect data, or track interactions. Such behavior is governed by the respective third partyâ€™s privacy policy, not this site.

## Analytics

This site does not use analytics or tracking services. Visitor behavior is not recorded or analyzed.

## Data Sharing and Retention

Because no personal data is collected, no information is retained or shared with third parties.

## Your Rights

As this website does not collect or store personal data, there is no personal information to access, correct, or delete.
